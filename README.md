## EXP|CON
EXP|CON is a convenient, cost-effective, and comfortable way to experience live concerts and to enjoy the thrill of a live performance from the comfort of your home. There is no worry of traveling and dealing with large crowded venues, and then having to struggle finding a good seat! With EXP|CON you are able to quickly bootup the application using either your personal computer, mobile or even plug in your AR or VR headset and join in to the live concert.

Gone is waiting in long lines or camping out during festivals, just login and enjoy with EXP|CON! If youâ€™ve missed a live show you can use the Archival feature to experience the performance again!

## How was the EXP|CON website built?
This website was built using React, NEXT.JS, Typescript, SASS, Stripe payment functionality, Eslint, NPM and tons of NPM packages. Being a NEXT.JS app, the website was deployed using Vercel for now. I plan to self-host this app on Amazon Web Services in the future.
